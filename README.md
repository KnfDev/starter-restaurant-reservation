# Welcome to the Restaurant RÃªve Sans Fin reservation and tables management platform

## Aloha I am a developer based in Hawaii I hope you enjoy my project and if you have any questions please [contact me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenneth-mai-21839a21a/)!  

This is a mock restaurant resrvation system designed for restaurant use.  

Could be repurposed for customer use if we add an authorization validation to only show certain features for restaurant management. 

This project was built with Javascript, NodeJS, React, Css, and Bootstrap. Postgresql and knex is utilized for the database interactions.

# To view a demo please visit [my deployed project](https://knf-restaurant-client.herokuapp.com/dashboard).  It may take a moment to load as it's hosted on free Heroku server

# To start
1. run `npm install`
2. in terminal for back-end `npm run start:dev`
3. in terminal for front end `npm run start`

This will take you to the landing page that displays the current dates reservations and any currently existing tables including relevant information for both

While this is meant for restaurant use, I wanted to demonstrate a modern view that could be appealing on the customer side as well
